The chile relleno, for example, is packed with Oaxacan cheese and served over a tomato sauce that is somehow one of the best things in the city. And, if they’re available, you should always get an order of steak tacos for the table. The guacamole is another must-order, and every meal here needs to end with the tres leches. This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the city, but you can still just walk in and get a table most nights.

Fortunately, Atla is an all-day Mexican spot in Noho from the people behind Cosme. The bright space and light food are actually best enjoyed during the day, when you can still order almost anything on the evening menu. Atla serves arguably the best avocado toast in the city, and the fish Milanese should definitely be on your table if you’re looking for something a bit more substantial.", :cuisine => "Mexican", :keyword => "Small Plates")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Claro", :location => "Gowanus", :address => " 284 3rd Ave", :description => "The food at Claro is Oaxacan-inspired, which means that you can come here and get a giant homemade tortilla filled with steak, cheese, and pickled chilis. This is called a tlayuda, and, if we were explaining it to a five-year-old, we might call it a Mexican pizza folded in half. There are tetelas (triangular tortilla pockets) and memelas (large tostadas, essentially), and the mole here is some of the best we’ve had. When you stop by, they might be serving it over something like veal cheeks or goat - and it should be on your table no matter what.

And even then, it wasn’t a guarantee. These days, it’s easier to get in, but the Mexican food is without a doubt still some of the best around.

The food at this family-run spot in Bushwick is bright and fresh, and there’s stuff here you won’t find at the average Mexican place. Try the crab tostadas or the spicy guacamole.

It’s the fact that they clean up your placemat with what looks like a whiteboard eraser when you drop some crumbs. It’s the fact that even though it can be tough to get a table here, they make you feel like you were personally invited to this party once you sit down.

But they pull it off. Maybe because the food is actually good, or maybe because it’s a fun place to eat. Carbone is a tiny red-sauce Italian spot in Greenwich Village, and it both looks and feels like the set of a film about mobsters who eat a lot. The curtains are always drawn on the front windows, but if you’re able to book a table, you can get a look at what goes down in here.

We (perhaps falsely) assume this is how real Italian people like their noodles, and we wouldn’t have this dish any other way.

The Balinese food at Selamat Pagi is relatively light, but won’t leave you needing chicken tenders halfway through the show. You can’t go wrong with the pumpkin curry or spicy beef rendang, and the soju cocktails with hibiscus and passionfruit are a nice base before big plastic cups of beer at the venue.", :cuisine => "Balinese", :keyword => "Casual Weeknight Dinner")

Instead of spending two hours texting things like “Eggs aren’t meat!” and “You knew she was gluten-intolerant,” you should just bring your group to Cafe Mogador, the Moroccan place with something for everyone. Your friend who wants “a good vibe” will appreciate that Mogador has a partytime feel, and your friend who suggested that you all cook at her townhouse in Clinton Hill will love the back dining room that looks like a greenhouse.", :cuisine => "Mediterranean", :keyword => "Casual Weeknight Dinner")

It feels like an old-timey members-only drinking club (in a cool, not annoying way), and both the drinks and food (small plates and raw bar) are very good. Just know it’s seating-only (no standing at the bar), and that it tends to get packed later in the night - so you might have to wait to get in if you don’t show up on the early side.", :cuisine => "American", :keyword => "Action At The Bar")

Rather than pre-gaming at a similarly cramped spot where you’ll spill the first quarter of your drink just trying to step away from the bar, hang out at the picnic tables in Pearl’s big backyard.

Start with the kale salad or share the cheese plate, and then get the burger, which comes with some fantastic fries.

The dimly-lit space has plenty of bar seating, along with cocktails and affordable wines, and wood-fired Neapolitan-style pizzas.

The menu is a mix of simple American and Italian dishes, like personal pizzas, a burger, and brick chicken. It also happens to be a family-friendly spot, so keep it in mind if you need to feed your kids before they fall asleep during the first Sufjan Stevens song.
