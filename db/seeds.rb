Fortunately, Atla is an all-day Mexican spot in Noho from the people behind Cosme. The bright space and light food are actually best enjoyed during the day, when you can still order almost anything on the evening menu.

This is called a tlayuda, and, if we were explaining it to a five-year-old, we might call it a Mexican pizza folded in half. There are tetelas (triangular tortilla pockets) and memelas (large tostadas, essentially), and the mole here is some of the best we’ve had. When you stop by, they might be serving it over something like veal cheeks or goat - and it should be on your table no matter what.

It’s the fact that they clean up your placemat with what looks like a whiteboard eraser when you drop some crumbs. It’s the fact that even though it can be tough to get a table here, they make you feel like you were personally invited to this party once you sit down.

The curtains are always drawn on the front windows, but if you’re able to book a table, you can get a look at what goes down in here.

Restaurant.create(:name => "Sushi Yasaka", :location => "Upper West Side", :address => " 251 W 72nd St", :description => "Upper West Siders swear by Yasaka – when we polled friends for this list, the Yasaka fans were easily the most fervent in their passion. The specials are great: go for the $24 mini omakase with 6 pieces of sushi topped with interesting sauces and a roll, or the $26 Miyabi with six pieces of traditional sushi, eight pieces of sashimi, and a roll.", :cuisine =>  "Sushi")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Hasaki", :location => "East Village", :address => " 210 E 9th St", :description => "Hasaki’s been open since the early 80s, and they still serve some of the freshest sushi in the East Village.

Restaurant.create(:name => "Hart's", :location => "Bedford-Stuyvesant", :address => " 506 Franklin Ave.", :description => "Hart’s is a tiny place in Bed-Stuy, and if you bring a date, they’ll be impressed that you know of such a cool neighborhood spot. The food is Mediterranean/American, and you can expect things like ricotta with stewed vegetables and some quality seafood. They also typically have a good soundtrack going that may or may not involve Ja Rule and Ashanti, and it’s nice and dim with a candle on a very table.", :cuisine => "Mediterranean", :keyword => "Date Night")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Karasu", :location => "Fort Greene", :address => " 166 Dekalb Ave", :description => "Secret things are cooler than non-secret things. That’s a fact, and every person you will ever meet knows it. So if you want someone to think that you’re at least a little bit cool, take them to Karasu. It’s a Japanese restaurant and bar hidden behind another restaurant and bar in Fort Greene - and while you could call it a “speakeasy,” it doesn’t have any of the pretension of most places in that category. The cocktails are different, the food is great, and the space is intimate.  Just be sure to make a reservation.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "Japanese")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Sauvage", :location => "Greenpoint", :address => " 905 Lorimer Street", :description => "If date night rolls around and you realize you have nothing planned, don’t panic. Just go to Sauvage. It’s a French-ish place in Greenpoint, and it typically isn’t too hard to get a table here. The dining room feels like a nice bistro that you’d find in Paris (which is typically a good thing for date night), and there’s a lot of sidewalk seating for when the weather is nice. As for the food, it’s good enough to keep you happy, but not so mind-blowing that you’ll forget to talk to each other. The chocolate tart makes for a strong finish.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "French Bistro")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Ops", :location => "Bushwick", :address => " 346 Himrod Street", :description => "We like slice joints, but if you try to bring a date to a place like Joe’s, he or she might be slightly disappointed. So if you want to eat pizza romantically, go to Ops. It’s a nice neighborhood pizza spot with brick walls, a tiled floor, and a rotating selection of natural wines. The pizza is also very good (especially the square one), the service is exceptionally friendly, and everything is pretty affordable. It’s in Bushwick, and there are plenty of bars nearby for a drink afterward.", :cuisine => "Pizza")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Dante", :location => "Greenwich Village", :address => " 79-81 MacDougal St.", :description => "Why do Australians keep opening cool restaurants in New York? Not entirely sure, but we’ll keep going to them. Dante took the space of a famous old Greenwich Village cafe (also called Dante), and turned it into a fun, casual, extremely useful and impressively tasty restaurant. Points for history, and also points for negronis on tap.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "American")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Mimi", :location => "Greenwich Village", :address => " 185 Sullivan St.", :description => "Mimi might be the straight-up sexiest restaurant in New York. If that makes you picture some rooftop lounge with views of the Empire State Building and shiny leather booths and elevator music in the background, we don’t mean that kind of “sexy.” Mimi is legitimately sexy thanks to a combination of attractive French waiters, tightly packed tables, and a marble bar that turns out ice-cold martinis. The food is funky, modern French stuff like beef tartare with quail yolk.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "French Bistro")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Lilia", :location => "Williamsburg", :address => " 567 Union Avenue", :description => "Lilia is a knockout in every way: stunning space, awesome pastas, fried cacio e pepe, great wine list, and soft serve ice cream with sprinkles on top. This restaurant just does it all right. We would usually tell you that the best place to experience a place like Lilia would be to bring a bunch of people and try everything. But the actual best way to experience Lilia? Bring one other person and try everything.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "Italian")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Wildair", :location => "Lower East Side", :address => " 142 Orchard St.", :description => "Whether you’re just starting to really get to know someone or you’ve known them for a while, it can never hurt to remind someone that you know where the cool sh*t is. So point your date night in the direction of Wildair. On first glance, it just looks like a casual wine bar - but the food here also happens to be pretty incredible. If your ideal date night includes interesting wine, interesting food, and the feeling of being much more French than you actually are, get involved. Know that you can’t make reservations, but it’ll be worth the wait.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "Small Plates")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Uva", :location => "Upper East Side", :address => " 1486 2nd Ave", :description => "The essential Upper East Side date night restaurant, Uva won’t change your life, but it will provide you a nice, mildly romantic evening with solid Italian food on 2nd Avenue.

Restaurant.create(:name => "Fedora", :location => "West Village", :address => " 239 W. 4th St.", :description => "Fedora feels like the kind of place where New Yorkers in pinstripe suits and furs would have hung out fifty years ago. And maybe they did - this place has been open for even longer, and was originally operated by a woman named Fedora, who seems like she would have been friends with people that would wear pinstripe suits and fur. Fedora might no longer own the place, but it retains its classic New York appeal: low lighting, leather stools, stiff drinks, and great food. The fur is optional - a date is not.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "Small Plates")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Prune", :location => "East Village", :address => " 54 E. 1st St.", :description => "Prune is best known for brunch, when no reservations are taken. And if you’re willing to wait, the food (and the Bloody Marys) will be great. But we actually most strongly endorse Prune at dinner-time, when the restaurant feels like the experimental American version of a cozy little French bistro. The menu is interesting, and yes, they even take reservations.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "French Bistro")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Virginia's", :location => "East Village", :address => " 647 E 11th St", :description => "If your idea of date night involves eating some tuna tartare and maybe a few oysters if things get crazy, somewhere near midtown, Virginia’s is not your spot. Located on Avenue C, the food at Virginia’s is about as rich as it gets - expect plenty of butter, and expect risotto to pretty much always be on the menu. Work it off with the not-short walk to the subway afterwards.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "French Bistro")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Maison Premiere", :location => "Williamsburg", :address => " 298 Bedford Ave.", :description => "Some things should never change. Like Maison Premiere. Their combination was pretty much made for date night: impressive, delicious cocktails, excellent raw bar offerings, an insane back garden, and a 1920s vibe that feels actually cool, rather than dated. Whether it’s your first stop to kick off your evening or you make it the main event, MP is a place you can count on.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "Oysters")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Hotel Delmano", :location => "Williamsburg", :address => " 82 Berry St", :description => "Or maybe you need to not take your date to Maison Premiere for the 13th time. Switch things up with Hotel Delmano, another Williamsburg cocktail bar that gives MP some stiff competition across all fronts: cocktails, raw bar, and atmosphere. But most importantly, Hotel Delmano never fails to make us feel like we’re in one of the coolest rooms in Brooklyn. Your date night routine needs more of this place.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "Raw Bar")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Four Horsemen", :location => "Williamsburg", :address => " 295 Grand St.", :description => "The Four Horsemen might be a tiny room, but it’s the kind of space you walk into and immediately decide you’d be happy to stay a while. (Also, built-in intimacy is never a bad thing.) It’s a natural wine bar, meaning you’ll have no idea what any of the wines are. But this also means The Four Horsemen provides a built-in activity: talking about, learning about, and drinking stuff you’ve never tried. On top of that, the food here is really impressive, and it’s fun to sample from the small plates as you try funky wines.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "Small Plates")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Estela", :location => "Nolita", :address => " 47 E. Houston St.", :description => "Some small plates places are ideal for groups. Estela is not one of them. This is a small plates restaurant for date night. It’s cramped, it’s crowded, it’s... slanted, it’s loud - but more so than all of those things, Estela is an excellent restaurant. Come with someone who is serious about food, and it’s pretty much a given that you will have a great night.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "American")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Littleneck", :location => "Gowanus", :address => " 288 3rd Ave.", :description => "Many date nights, you’re not looking for a big production - you’re just looking for something that feels slightly more special than your typical Tuesday night go-to. Littleneck is the ideal casual date spot: a subtly sexy version of a beach shack in the middle of Gowanus, serving lots of seafood and one excellent burger. A great bar, low lighting, candles on the tables, and a solid cocktail list give the place more ambience than the usual spots where you’d get a great lobster roll around town.", :keyword => "Date Night", :cuisine => "American")

Restaurant.create(:name => "West-Bourne", :location => "SoHo", :address => " 137 Sullivan Street", :description => "This new all-day cafe in Soho is inspired by “1960s Los Angeles,” but all that really means is that they serve healthy-ish brunch at all hours of the day and their menu is full of words like Malibu Waffle and Bay Cities Cauli. It’s pretty casual (you order at a counter) so it works nicely for a solo grain bowl or a laid-back brunch with friends. They also have beer, wine, and their own kombucha. Because of course they have their own kombucha.", :keyword => "Brunch", :cuisine => "American")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Pheasant", :location => "Williamsburg", :address => " 445 Graham Ave", :description => "Regardless of where you actually live, eating at Pheasant will feel like your personal neighborhood spot.

Restaurant.create(:name => "Evelina", :location => "Fort Greene", :address => " 211 Dekalb Ave", :description => "Evelina is a new-ish Mediterranean restaurant in the part of Fort Greene that has tons of good neighborhood brunch spots. But Evelina is particularly worth checking out if you’re looking for an attractive space that’s a big step up from your go-to hangover brunch spot. They serve nice cocktails, duck confit, pasta, and other things that are good for people who are tired of eating eggs on weekends.", :cuisine => "Mediterranean", :keyword => "Brunch")
Restaurant.create(:name => "La Contenta Oeste", :location => "West Village", :address => " 78 W 11th St", :description => "If the brunch spectrum runs from boozy-rowdy to quiet-boring, La Contenta falls somewhere in the middle. No one is asking questions about bottomless deals, but they also have $8 brunch cocktails, along with very good poblano benedicts and chilaquiles, and you could easily hang out here drinking for a while. The space itself is much larger than the original LES location, and they also take reservations.", :cuisine => "Mexican", :keyword => "Brunch")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Flora Bar", :location => "Upper East Side", :address => " 945 Madison Ave", :description => "Flora Bar in the Met Breuer is run by the people behind Estela (another place for excellent brunch) and it’s definitely not your typical museum restaurant. Mostly because they serve food that would warrant a trip here, without actually going to the museum. There’s white sturgeon caviar, lobster and crab dumplings, and lamb ribs, along with more classic brunch options like waffles, egg and cheese with tomato chutney, and shakshuka with rye flatbread.", :cuisine => "Raw Bar", :keyword => "Brunch")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Old Rose", :location => "West Village", :address => " 113 Jane St", :description => "We wouldn’t blame you for assuming the new restaurant in the Jane Hotel would be the kind of place to avoid on a Saturday at brunch. But most people still haven’t discovered Old Rose, and you should use that to your advantage. The space is also big and bright, so the next time you have to organize a group brunch, suggest this place. Your friends will be impressed that you know about it, and you can pretend that you don’t care how impressed they are. The menu is mostly Italian, but not the heavy kind. At brunch, you can get things like an egg sandwich, olive oil cake, or a pizza. Both the clam and vodka versions are excellent.", :cuisine => "Italian", :keyword => "Brunch")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Shuka", :location => "Greenwich Village", :address => " 38 Macdougal St", :description => "Shuka is from the same people behind Cookshop and Vic’s, and, like those places, it’s nice enough for a meal with someone like your old college professor, but not so expensive that can’t come here last-minute with friends. The food is Mediterranean and you can start your brunch here with some cinnamon rolls or ricotta fritters or both. There are also some healthier things like beet hummus and a grain bowl, although chocolate babka French toast is also an option.", :cuisine => "Brunch", :keyword => "Mediterranean")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Chez Ma Tante", :location => "Greenpoint", :address => " 90 Calyer St", :description => "The type of food they serve at Chez Ma Tante is tough to pin down. At dinner they have things like pierogies and roast chicken, and at brunch, you can get falafel, a hot dog, an excellent caesar salad, or an egg sandwich. You can also get what are probably our favorite new pancakes in the city. They come crispy and topped with butter, and you should order them.

Restaurant.create(:name => "Golda Kitchen", :location => "Bedford-Stuyvesant", :address => " 504 Franklin Ave", :description => "Golda is a tiny spot in Bed-Stuy that’s currently only open in the daytime. It looks kind of like a coffee shop, but there’s a surprising amount of food (that you order at the counter). They have such things as a fried chicken sandwich, an acai bowl, and a plate of cauliflower that comes with a soft boiled egg and a magenta sauce. Most of those things are very good - although the toast with strawberry jam, foie gras, lemon curd, hazelnuts, and chocolate is just a little too confusing. Know that there aren’t many seats, and you might have to wait for one", :cuisine => "Mediterranean", :keyword => "Brunch")
Restaurant.create(:name => "Lalito", :location => "Chinatown", :address => " 104 Bayard St", :description => "Lalito is doing its own thing, and we’re very okay with that. It’s a new restaurant in Chinatown from the former chef at El Rey, and you can get some vegan chicharrones here. Or a caesar salad with seaweed and nutritional yeast. If any of that sounds iffy to you (as it should), just know that the food here is actually very good. At brunch they do breakfast tacos, but you can also get coconut grits or some granola with roasted yams.
